# Retrospective

Retrospective serves as the team's feedback loop on various ways of work. It boosts teamwork efficiency and effectiveness by asking what worked, what didn't, why they didn't, and how to refine them. While reflections are typically internal, they can also be used to evaluate external processes and provide feedback to those managing those processes.

In agile delivery, retrospective is conducted every sprint (two weeks) but teams have the flexibility to adjust their cadence accordingly.
